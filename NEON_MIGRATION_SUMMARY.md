# MongoDB to Neon DB Migration Summary

## Migration Completed Successfully ✅

The community platform has been successfully migrated from MongoDB to Neon DB (PostgreSQL).

### Changes Made:

1. **Environment Configuration**

    - Removed `MONGODB_URI` from `.env` file
    - Kept `DATABASE_URL` for Neon DB connection

2. **Database Schema**

    - The project was already using PostgreSQL schema with proper table definitions:
        - `users` table with volunteer management features
        - `posts` table for community requests/offers
        - `donations` table for donation management
        - `events` table for community events
        - `emergency_contacts` table for emergency services
        - `history_logs` table for audit trails

3. **Code Base**

    - All models already converted to use Neon DB SQL queries
    - Database connection using `@neondatabase/serverless` driver
    - No Mongoose/MongoDB dependencies found

4. **Documentation Updates**
    - Updated `temp/feature-plan.md` to reflect PostgreSQL usage

### Database Features:

-   **Scalable**: Using Neon's serverless PostgreSQL
-   **Secure**: SSL required connections
-   **Modern**: JSONB support for flexible data structures
-   **Relational**: Proper foreign key relationships

### Testing:

-   ✅ Server starts successfully
-   ✅ Database connection established
-   ✅ Seed script runs without errors
-   ✅ All routes load properly

### Current Status:

The application is now fully running on Neon DB with all functionality intact. The migration maintained all existing features while providing the benefits of a modern PostgreSQL database.
